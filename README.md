# Nike-Store-Design
This is a basic, full-stack e-commerce website designed to emulate the clean, premium aesthetic of a sports retailer like Nike. The platform is built using foundational web technologies—PHP for backend logic, HTML and CSS for structure and style, and JavaScript for front-end interactivity—and is run on a local XAMPP server environment.
